                                                                                
  Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?                                       
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:                                      
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,                                 
  And Summer's lease hath all too short a date:                                 
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,                                    
  And oft' is his gold complexion dimm'd:                                       
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,                                   
  By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;                              
  But thy eternal Summer shall not fade,                                        
  Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,                             
  When in eternal lines to time thou growest:                                   
  So long as men can breathe,or eyes can see,                                   
  So long lives this,and this gives life to thee.
