   Bee Movie Script - Dialogue TranscriptVoila! Finally, the Bee Movie script is
 here for all you fans of the Jerry Seinfeld animated movie. This puppy is a tra
nscript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings 
of the movie to get the dialogue. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast n
ames in there and all that jazz, so if you have any corrections, feel free to dr
op me a line.bjjihgjhhjjou'll have some Bee Movie quotes (or even a monologue or
 two) to annoy your coworkers with in the meantime, right?And swing on back to D
rew's Script-O-Rama afterwards -- because reading is good for your noodle. Bette
r than Farmville, anyway.Bee Movie Script    According to all known lawsof aviat
ion,  there is no way a beeshould be able to fly.  Its wings are too small to ge
tits fat little body off the ground.  The bee, of course, flies anyway  because 
bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible.  Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Ye
llow, black. Yellow, black.  Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little.  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!  Ooming!  Hang on a second.  Hello?  - Barry?- Adam?
